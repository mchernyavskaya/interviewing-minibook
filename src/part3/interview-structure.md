# Interview Structure

You are part of a hiring committee. You've got your interview plan and know what you're about to find out. How do you go from there? 

As I've pointed out earlier, structured interviews make a big difference when it comes to successful interviewing. Generally, each interview consists of three phases: 

1. Introduction
2. Questioning
3. Roundup

As I pointed out, preperation is very important. Nevertheless, I would recommend doing that preperation timely before the interview. That way, the questions and the concept is still fresh in your mind and the interview will come more natural. The perfect time to do this is the day before the interview. When you do this for the first time for a specific role, consider spending 1-2 hours preparing. 

On consecutive interviews for the same role, it will most likely be only 10 minutes for each interview. Whatever you do, don't skip this prep. Undoubtedly you've been in an interview situation, where you were interviewed and your interviewer had not read your CV nor anything prepared for the interview. 

What you will need to prepare is: 

1. The input from the Interview Plan (to know what you should be asking)
2. The CV of the Candidate
3. The Internet or Colleagues who also do interviews, to give input for questions. 

## Introduction

The first part of the interview is the introduction. The main goals for this part are to give the interviewee a human face to relate to and to help him calm down a little before the questioning starts. Relaxed people will give much better and thoughtful answers than nervous ones. Consider spending a bit more than 5 minutes on this.

In this time, you want to introduce yourself and have the interviewee introduce him or herself. Do some brief small talk with the other person before you start. Even if you are not the most extroverted person and do not value the concept of small talk, do it anyway. The goal is to relax the candidate at this point. Even if he/she notices, the chat is artificial - so is the entire concept of job interviews. It will help the candidate relax nevertheless. It will also show that you are not a "question robot" who does not care about the personality on the other side. They might notice it's hard for you to small talk, but you at least try to help them cool down. When you do small talk, ask things where it's obvious that the answer will not be rated. Also watch out to not ask anything personal. That can become inappropriate really quickly - especially as the context of an interview is highly formal. 

To wrap this section up, give the candidate a heads up on what this interview is going to be about. This way he/she knows what to expect and that the interview is now starting. 

## Questioning

This is the main, and most important part of the interview. I recommend that you prepare a template of questions for all people you ask. Then you make a copy for that template to customize it a bit. This way you will gather enough data to baseline candidates. At the same time, you will want to make some adjustments for individuals to address specific parts of their experience that might be relevant. 

To get to the generic part, that all candidates are being asked, look at the requirements from the interview plan and think about what kind of questions might give you an answer to this. Always try asking open questions rather than closed questions. 

A _closed question_ asks for a concrete answer. "Can you operate electric drills?", "Which Programming Languages do you program?" or "How many books have you published so far?" are all closed questions. They encourage short answers, like "Yes", "I know Java, C++ and Python" or "three". The answer from these questions often kills the conversation flow. There's little to follow up on them. And you can do nothing but trust the answer. You will not get an understanding about how well one can program, use an electric drill or how well the book sold after publishing. You will also not hear any reflections about how things went and what the candidate wants to improve on. 

_Open questions_ ask for an explanation. "How would you build a table by yourself?", "Can you tell me about the last software project you've built?" or "What was it like to publish your last book?" effectively ask for the the same things. The candidate will however have to explain his rationale, his thinking and also reflect on how things went there. As a bonus, you can easily ask follow up questions: "You just said that you had a hard time to hit the deadline on that project. What would you do the next time to prevent this from happening again?". 

Asking open questions has some benefits:

* You will more likely catch the "brilliance" or "genius" of a person. When saying "Yes" to the Electric drill, he has no way to tell you that he's also a really good woodworking artist and creates beautiful things of wood. 
* You will not only learn what you are asking for, but also you can validate how well the candidate understands his/her domain because he needs to explain that to you. 
* The interview experience for a the candidate is closer to a normal conversation and therefore more natural and more relaxing. If the interview experience is better, the candidate will also much more likely accept your offer later. 

As a downside, open questions take much longer to answer. This means, that you can't really ask so many of them. When you prepare your interview's skeleton, don't plan for more than 6-8 questions. Most likely, you'll only be able to do five of them. Often however, will answers to one question also give you the answer to another of your questions. Therefore it does not hurt to have some backup. However, mark the most important questions for yourself to be sure you don't forget skip one by accident. 

All good and well. Your interview plan asks for "Find out if candidate is a team player" now how on earth do you convert that into an open question? You can't ask "Are you a team player?" straight away. Not only because it's a closed question, but also because certainly nobody would answer that with "no" in an interview. A good trick to convert almost any requirement into an open question is to ask for a situation in the past where the interviewee has shown the desired behavior. Good team players will step back from their own goals to help others when they struggle for example. So you could ask: "Can you tell me about a situation, where one of your colleagues was struggling?" The answer to that question will reveal how the person felt about that situation and how he handled it. Does he understand that everyone struggles once in a while and that the performance of the team is more important than one's individual performance? Did he offer help by himself? Was he asked to do it? Or did he not at all get involved in helping that colleague. All that should give you a good indicator, if that person is a team player or not. 

"Can you tell me about a situation, in which..." questions are a good pattern for asking interview questions. It's easy to take almost anything you want to find out and convert it into such a question. It also shows to work better than hypothetical situations. I would argue that hypothetical questions are too simple to answer because they lack all of the nasty context and detail that past situations from reality bring with them. 

One thing that is commonly overrated is to review a candidate's CV with him. Iterating over his last few years of professioal experience. While there is some value in this, I believe in general it occupies way more time than necessary. If you've prepared your interview plan well enough, you know what you want to find out. Asking the candidate to describe his experience in general will most likely not give an answer to these questions. 

Once you've got your skeleton done, it's time to tweak it for the individual. You will probably still keep your most important questions in there. Nevertheless, when an applicant brings a really rare and relevant experience from a previous job, ask about that too. 

In case you feel insecure about the questions you prepared, run them through some of your colleagues or HR. This will give you confidence you're asking the right kind of things. And after all, once the interview is done you want to have as much confidence as possible whether to hire or to not hire. 

This is the longest part of the interview, it will take the entire time minus 20 minutes for roundup and introduction. 

## Roundup

The Roundup should start 15 minutes before the end of the interview. In this last phase, you want to give the candidate the chance to ask questions about the company, and give him an understanding on what will happen next. 

Finish up the interview by thanking the candidate for his time and give him a heads up on how the process will continue. That heads up should include two things: First, when he will get feedback about success or failure of this interview round, second on what the next step or steps will look like. To be able to give a clear answer on this question, you need to be aware of the interview plan and you have to have a good understanding on how long your company will take to deliver feedback to the candidate.
