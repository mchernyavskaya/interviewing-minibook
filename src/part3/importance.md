# The Importance of Preperation

By the time you get here, you've already spent a lot reading about theoretical and ethical aspects of hiring. This is, because going into interviews well prepared makes all the difference. The most important reasons for me are:  

* There's been a lot of evidence, that well prepared and structured interviews [can be 2x more effective in finding the right fit](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hrm.20026). Thus, reducing the amount of time and money spent in recruiting. 
* If you come unprepared to an interview, most often the interviewee can tell. That lack of preperation can easily be interpreted as lack of respect or the company being a chaotic workplace. 
* Having a structure and a plan helps you improve over time, as you will note what works well and what does not work well within an interview and can correct easily. 

For that reason, bear with me for that chapter until we'll go into actual interview practices.
