# Preparing the Candidate

For this chapter, imagine yourself as someone who is right now looking to find a new job. You're probably interviewing with several companies at the same time. Some of which you'd prefer over the others.

In this situation you probably have three needs: 

1. You want to know as much as possible about the company you're hoping to work with. Is it a place, you'd enjoy? Will the work be challenging? Do you agree with the company's values? 
2. You would like to present yourself as good as possible. Not only to get the job but also to be sure, you're getting a _really_ good offer. 
3. You would like to understand where you are in the interview process. How many interviews are still to go? Which interviews will be on site? How long will the interview process roughly take? 

I would argue that it makes a lot of sense for a company to offer answers to these questions. As all of them are critical aspects to lead to hiring success, these answers should be given as soon as possible - ideally at the time when the candidate applies. Luckily, it is not that hard to give applicants support in these three needs. 

If you have an interview plan, why not share a brief summary of the steps with the candidate? This can be part of the application confirmation or can be shared by the recruiter at the beginning of the process. That summary would typically contain a list of the interviews and their rough scopes. 

To support the candidate to present himself better in each of the interviews, add the name of the interviewer, the topics (again) and - if required - prep suggestions to the invite. Especially when you're running a skill interview that requires any preparation or equipment, candidate will appreciate a lot when being told beforehand. This is particularly important for interviewing software engineers. When a programming exercise is part of the interview, send them a mail what they're required to have installed on their computer (e.g. Java Version 11, Maven, IDE of their choice,..). Otherwise, they'll lose precious time trying to get basic things running under high pressure. 

You will also want to make sure that the interviewees get a good understanding of how life in your company is. To give a first impression, many companies put their values, their culture (and often the benefits) into the careers section of their website. Add pictures of the office into the mix to make it even better. Additionally, schedule time when doing on site interviews for having successful candidates meeting the team or giving them a tour through the office. Be sure, there is enough time to address their question after the end of every single interview. Coming from another angle, you might also want to excite them about the product or services your company offers - that they will work on. For that reason, share information about that to them. This can be content on your website, but also blog posts, articles or conference talks on youtube.
