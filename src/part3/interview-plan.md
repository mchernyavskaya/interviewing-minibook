# The Interview Plan

Usually, an interviewing process consists of several interviews that are conducted sequencially for each applying candidate. This is, because there's many things you'd like to have certainity about before you hand out a signed contract. Things you might be interested in might be: technical skills, past experience, specific soft skills (e.g. communication), cultural fit, motivation to work in the new role or potential to grow over time. As all these things can't be reasonably figured out in one hour, several interviews are deducted.

The Interview Plan describes what interviews exist in an interview process and what their goal is. Many larger companies interview plans as policies. Meaning that you'll need to adhere to them. If there's no predefined plan, I recommend, sitting together with HR and the hiring committee to define one that will work for the positions you have. The idea is that all candidates applying have to go through all of these interviews. 

At my previous employer, we had a standard interview plan that was to be used for all open positions. It would always consist of four interviews, carried out by four different people. Here's a slightly modified version of it. Please note that the order was not specified, so I am giving the order we used. 

1. Passion: See if the candidate is a personable fit and brings the right passion and motivation for the job. It was a very enterpreneural company, so people with a "can do" and "hands on" mindset were what we wanted. This interview was to be conducted by HR, specifically recruiting. 
2. Cultural Fit: Does candidate match the culture of the office. This interview had to be done by someone not part of the team. 
3. Skills: Does the interviewee posess the required skills to be successful in his role? Interview was to be led by a senior domain expert from the hiring team. 
4. Potential: Can the hiring manager see growth capabilities in the interviewee that will ensure future development and growth of that person within the company? To be led by the hiring manager. 

While I don't think this is the perfect interview plan, it was worked reasonably well for us. 

For each of the stages defined in the interview plan, there should be some (written) specifications about what topics are to be addressed. (e.g. motivation for job change was part of _Passion_). Having that clearly specified helps everyone to be certain that all important things have been addressed. It also helps to build a pool of interviewers over time. Without such a pool, hiring _fast_ is very hard because of interviewer availabilities.

## Designing an Interview Plan

How does one design an interview plan? In collaboration with others most likely. The Interview Committee, HR, other managers or experienced interviewers will give good input. Ask them to join a brainstorming session on the matter. 

List all the things you want to find out about a candidate before and put them on sticky notes. Once done, cluster them together into categories. These categories will then make your interviews. If you have more categories than you can reasonably run interviews per candidate, filter them out or do multiple categories per interview. 

Then give each of the interviews a name (because everything is better when it has a name), describe the qualifications needed to run it, and assign specific goals to each interview. When you start with this, keep it lean; you can improve over time. Keep in mind that the interviewer will need to be able to execute on that script within 45 minutes. Remember also that the candidate will want to ask his/her own questions and there is some time that will go into introduction and small talk. 

> **Passion Interview (45 min, by HR):**
>
> * Run "Sales Pitch" to get interviewee excited about job. 
> * Give overview about the company
>
> Questions to Ask:
>
> * Check if the interviewee is personable in the context of our company. Will he/she be able to get along with future collegues? 
> * Is he excited about the opportunity? What excites him about the company/role he is in? 
> * Why is he looking for a new job? 
> * Is he/she self reflected on personal strengths and weaknesses? 
> * What are his career ambitions over the next five years? 
> * Salary expectation and possible join date

## The Interview Funnel

Once you've got your interviews defined, it's time to think about the order. Here's a bit of theory that will help you with that.

When you run many people through an interview process, the number of interviewees per interview stage will decrease over the interview process. All candidates will be in the first interview you run, while only a percentage will arrive at the last interviewing stage. At each stage, most likely fewer people will be interviewed than in the stage before. This is called the interview funnel. 

**TODO: image about funnel** 

Ideally, you want to lay out your interviews in a way that an equal portion of candidates are filtered after each stage. That will keep efforts and costs low on your side, at the same time it will ensure that people who are rejected have invested as little time as possible in the interviews. 

There are some tradeoffs however. These are the ones I find most common: 

If there are any hard, disqualifying facts, you might want to clarify them as early as possible (think of salary expectations or the will to travel). There's no point in running a person through four interviews, only to hear a "no" to such a short question at the end of the process.  

Interviews are expensive in general, but there will be some interviews, that are even more costy. Two examples are: 

* Skill interviews for IC roles in a team that is critically understaffed yet very important for the businesses success. In such a case it might make sense to run the skills interview later in the process to put as little disruption on the team as possible. 
* When a high level executive from your company wants to interview all applicants for a key position, it will naturally make sense, to have him interview last to protect his/her time as much as possible.
