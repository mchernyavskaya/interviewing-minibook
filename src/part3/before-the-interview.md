# Before the Interview

When I go into an interview - I always ensure to be calm and prepared. If the interviewer is nervous, unprepared or agitated, this does not make a good impression. Furthermore, the interviewee might pick up on these feelings and gets nervous. 

I reserve at least the 10 minutes before the interview starts for myself, to go through the candidate's CV, put the questions I have on a blank piece of paper and to generally calm down. If I can, I sit in the meeting room already (where nobody is bothering me), if not I look for a quiet space in the office. I prefer to write my questions on a new piece of paper for each candidate, as this will remind me of the questions (the act of physically writing) and because I don't want to have an open computer or cell phone in the interview as I find this very distracting. 

If the interview is via Skype, I send a message to the candidate 2 minutes before start of the interview. I also make sure that Skype (or what ever other tool) is working properly and does not ask me to install a version update. I wanna be sure that the tech is working when I am ready to go. In any case it is a good idea to also have the phone number of the candidate ready - a fall back I had to use very often. 

If you have kids, I would also advise you not to do interviews Monday morning interviews. If you are part of the club, you probably know that kids _only_ get sick over the weekend and _never_ want to go to kindergarten or school on Mondays. Chances are, you might find your self arriving slightly late and stressed out. If you find yourself in these words, just don't schedule interviews Monday mornings. Everyone deserves better. 

A last piece of advice be sure to know the first and the last name _and_ how to pronounce them correctly. Not being able to recall the other person's name in an interview is never appreciated.
