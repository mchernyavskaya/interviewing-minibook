# Your Worst Enemies

Hiring is not an easy endeavor. There’s numerous studies that show large portions of today's workforce being disengaged and unhappy. Let’s look at some reasons why hiring goes wrong. 


## Time

When interviewing people, time is your single worst enemy. This is for two reasons: 
On one side, people interested in jobs will not only interview with you but also with other companies. One the other side, there’s surely some sort of urgency on your side to close the position as well. 
The longer your interview process takes, the more likely they get an offer from someone else in the meantime. Great companies can get from application to offer within one or two weeks. If your process takes significantly longer, you risk losing a great and engaged applicant to someone else. 

Imagine, you interview with two companies (A and B) that sound both interesting. Company B sends you an offer. Both companies sound good to you, but you know that there’s at least two more interviews with Company A to go. You can’t be sure that you’ll pass both of them; and you can’t be sure that you can make Company B wait long enough until A gives you an offer. 

Likewise, you’re interviewing with Company A. You think you’re doing really well and you’re rocking all their interviews. But it’s been a week since you had the last interview and you haven’t gotten feedback yet. Do you feel respected and valued from Company A? After all, maybe they are not as great as they pretend to be? Who knows that what they say about their culture is true after all? Are they running several candidates in parallel and wait for all of them to finish an interview stage? Uncertainty often yields negative thoughts. As a candidate, all of these question will decrease your interest and excitement about the company, making you sceptical, lose hope and interest. You’ll ultimately opt out. The day, an invitation for the “final interview” round comes, you might just not bother to answer even more. 

Speed in interview processes can’t be overrated. In my opinion, the goal should be to get from application to offer in less than two weeks - ideally one week. That’s still enough time to give the candidate enough time to think about you as an employer. It also gives more than enough time to run four or five interview rounds with that candidate. What this will for sure, is give the candidate a premier feeling of being respected and valued. Proceeding fast with an interview process is a big sign of respect for candidates. Furthermore, I’ve seen a much higher success rate for fast hiring processes than slow ones. 


## Priorities

If speed is that crucial in interview processes, how does it come that they still often take weeks or even month to finish? The answer most often is: priorities. The fact that your company trusts you to make hiring decisions means that you probably have a very important job and a lot of responsibilities already. Finding that time to do interviews can be a very hard task. 

Your ambition should be that the interview process moves with the maximum speed the candidate is able to do. Practically this means that all interviews should be done at the earliest time, the candidate is able to do. Feedback for that round and an invitation to the next round should be done immediately after, latest the day after an interview. 

Most of the time, there are people to support you. Recruiters or HR can and often will facilitate recruitment processes. Getting their buy in for a fast process can be crucial to achieve this. Give them access to your calendar (and keep your calendar up to date for that reason) so that they can arrange interviews for you without having to ask them to. Also encourage them to ask you if you would be able to move/cancel an existing appointment to accommodate for an interview. 


## Hiring Pressure

Because there are not enough hands on deck, the team has to work extra hard to compensate. Everyone is stressed out and really desperate to finally fill that position to get some relief. In such a situation, it can be very tempting to give someone the benefit of the doubt, when doubt should is in order. You’ll hear yourself (or other interviewers) say things like: “maybe I am interpreting too much in there…” or “He was probably just stressed out in that situation. Once he lands, he’ll do just fine”. 

When you are in such a situation, remind yourself, that the only way the situation could get worse, is by hiring the wrong candidate. Not only will a bad hire drag down the team morale, additionally, you’ll invest a lot in getting that person up to speed, giving him a lot of feedback and - maybe - replacing him in the end. That’s a huge chunk of work. When you consider the waiting time for the candidate to start, the time he gets introduction, the feedback conversations to be had, and then finally having to start hiring again - it can easily take half a year to identify and revert the situation, let alone running another interview process. 

For these reasons, it is important not to lower requirements and expectations when hiring under stress. In contrary, especially in this situation you should be as thorough as possible to find a good fit. 

## Toxic Thoughts

When hiring for a peer, subordinate or even for your future boss, there’s a lot of negative thoughts that might come up: That candidate is smarter than me - am I hurting my own career by hiring him? I don’t want anyone to get the job as my boss - because I want to keep my autonomy. I rejected the last five candidates that were presented to me - what will others think about me, when I also reject that one? That guy used to work in the company where Tom used to work - I hate Tom! 

Questions like these do sometimes creep into our thoughts. Regardless whether we like them or not. My advice would be to ask yourself if you can be fair and non judgemental in that situation. If you can’t, tell people that you’re afraid you’re biased and would prefer to either skip that candidate or not be part of that specific hiring panel. Keep in mind there’s a big responsibility in hiring. 
When you feel you’re not able to drive a car right now, the only responsible choice is to ask someone else to drive. 


## Uncertainty

Uncertainty plays out in two ways against you. 

Interview processes are inherently intransparent because both sides (company and candidates) do not want to fully disclose their motivations and reasonings. As an interviewer, you will probably never find out, how many other companies that candidate is talking to and what drives his decision to work with a specific one of them. This kind of uncertainty is innate for every hiring process; If not for being fast in your interview process I don’t know how to address this otherwise. 

The other kind of uncertainty is the one, when you sit together with the hiring committee at the end of an interview process and are not quite sure whether or not to hire to hire a specific candidate. Most often there is either very mixed opinions about the hiring choice, or a feeling that there’s not enough information present yet to make an informed decision. 

Personally, I would always opt for a “no hire” decision in that case. My rationale is that it is the job of the candidate to sell himself so that the potential employer wants to hire him. That there is uncertainty about how to proceed proofs that this was not done successfully. 

This may sound rather hash. However I do believe that uncertainty is caused by either a fuzzy cultural misfit of the candidate (where nobody can quite put a finger on) or because people do not yet understand what kind of person they are looking for to fill that position. In either way, hiring that candidate would be a lose-lose situation, putting that future employee in a spot where he/she will most likely fail to impress.
