# TODO: get rid of good vs bad recruiter

# Work with Recruiters

Recruiters can accelerate your hiring process and find a lot of excellent candidates. Given that your company can afford them, as they will typically ask for 25%-40% of the annual salary of the hire. 

As they come at a premium price, it is only reasonable to ask for premium service. 

## What Recruiters can do for you

When working with recruiters, they will be the first point of contact with potential applicants. They will listen to what kind of person you are looking for, and what to pay special attention to (e.g. experience with a special software tool, but also soft skills such as empathy can be criteria). 

Once they have a feeling, what company and job is about and what kind of personality you're looking for, they'll start their search. Typically they will either use social networks such as LinkedIn, or their own candidate pool. 

They'll typically approach these people either by a private message or email, giving some teaser of what kind of position they have to fill. In the next step, they'll have a first call with the potential candidate which has two purposes: First, to excite and engage the person about that opportunity. Second, to do a first check if he/she can be a potential fit for the job. Most often, recruiters also ask for salary expectations and earliest join date at this point. This is to prevent bad surprises at the end of the interview process for both parties. If the recruiter is briefed to check for any specifics, that also happens in this call. 

If the first call is successful, the recruiter will forward the candidate's CV together with his/her personal impression to the hiring manager. 

From this this point, the recruiter will act as middleman between the hiring company and the candidate. He/She will schedule interview appointments, ensure the candidate has an overview on the happenings in the recruiting process and will respond to any questions or requests the candidate has. What sounds quite simple in theory, is quite a challenging job. Consider that you'll probably be talking to a couple of candidates - and each candidate is talking to you and several of your colleagues. In such a complex setup, things can easily become confusing and information can get lost. Can you remember a time when you never heard again from a company that promised to get back to you "the next day"? That's probably what happened. When the responsibilty of communication with applicants is unclear, balls get dropped. Interview invites are not sent, applications are not responded to in timely manner. Great candidates will go and apply somewhere else, as they can only assume they failed the interview. 

## What Recruiters Do

While recruiters are a gift from heaven, they sometimes are considered quite the opposite. Which is a shame, because recruiters and hiring managers work on different aspects of the same goal: Find a great match for that vacancy in minimum time and for minimum cost. 

Naturally, recruiters will always be advocates for their candidates as they get paid for signed contracts. As as hiring manager you know that it is impossible to prove someone to be a good fit. It's only possible to prove someone is _not_ a good fit. In a healthy environment, you'll get to a stable balance, where the recruiters will ensure you're not neglecting applicants for too little reason. On the other hand, they'll understand that hiring can be a big risk and therefore diligence is in order. 

To get the best results, you can ensure that you are aligned on each other about what makes an ideal candidate. This starts by giving the recruiter a good briefing when the recruitment process starts. If it helps, introduce the recruiters to collegues that exhibit some of the characteristics you are looking after. Show them some CVs of candidates you'd find interesting or describe people you've worked with that produce stellar results. 

As I pointed out before, your view of the job to be hired and therefore what makes a candidate outstanding can and should change over time while you are interviewing. Therefore, giving feedback continuosely helps a lot to stay aligned. Feedback should be given about candidates rejected (why was he rejected? what was missing?) but also about candidates that impressed (what exactly did you like about that person? Why do you think he/she could be a good fit?). To be realistic: most of the candidates will show some of the positive and some of the negative. Just because a candidate failed to convince you does not mean he had some traits you found very valuable. Tell the recruiter. 

As with any feedback, it is most well received when it is respectful and honest. 

## Finding a fitting recruiter

Like with any other profession, there is a lot of good and bad recruiters out there. Bad recruiters gained more visibility by excessively spamming people on social networks with clearly non fitting job offers. It's a shame, because this continuoues to hurt the entire profession. 

There are _really_ good ones out there, though. When you can get involved in finding them, you should. From a candidate's point of view the recruiter represents your company. If you have a bad experience with the recruiter, you'll probably project this on the company. 

Imagine yourself a single parent of two kids. To take the call with the recruiter, you had to leave work earlier, pay a babysitter for your toddler and cleanup the room from all baby toys before you can join the video call. Now imagine, that recruiter is 15 minutes late, tries to convince you to a position you're clearly overqualified, or you just never hear again from him/her after the call is over. How likely are you to ever consider that company agian? Would you probably even tell your friends and collegues about the bad interviewing experience you made with that company? 

So, how can you tell what the right recruiter is? When interviewing recruiters, I always give them one task: I ask them to pick any present or past client (they don't need to tell me the name) and try to sell me a job at their company in 10 minutes. If I end up being excited and energized, the taks is accomplish. Bonus points, if they did customize the pitch to my work experience. Solving that exercise gives me confidence that they can attract people's interest. Additionally, I ask how they usually work together with hiring managers and with teams to see if they are in for the continuous feedback model I am advocating. I conclude with asking them to describe me their best hire and about one hire where everything went wrong (think of fire alert in the middle of the interview, delayed flights,...) and how they dealt with that. 

Once they start working, have a look at the candidates they deliver. Do you feel the candidates they present do not fit what you described in the briefing? Is the feedback you give not helping? Do mistakes occur frequently, causing candidates to jump? Do you end up talking to people that are clear cultural misfits very often? These are good signs that things need to be changed. 

I can also recommend participating at least some of their acquisition calls with potential candidates. Not to evaluate them, but to learn from them. Doing interviews and getting information out of people friendly and efficient is the job of a recruiter. It's something he's as good at. Hiring managers are amateurs in that sense, having just a fraction of the practice in interviewing as recruiters do. Sitting with them in the early interviews will let you pick up some tricks and inspirations on how to become better at interviewing. It's a skill after all. What it also does is to give you an insight into the market to help you get a better understanding of their job's difficulties and how people can be attracted easily. 

## Working Together 

By now, you should have an understanding of how tricky the job of a recruiter is. Let alone the performance pressure as they work for commission. As they are doing an important job for you, it is only fair to make that job as easy as possible. Here are some simple things you can do. The beauty of them is that they will not only make your recruiter's life better, but it will also yield better results in hiring. 

* Respond Fast: When you get a CV to review or when you just finished an interview. Return feedback as soon as possible. People who are applying for a job are usually nothing but patient. If they don't get feedback quickly they might just disengage. Returning feedback at the earliest moment you can allows for a leaner process that will be appreciated by candidates, recruiters and ultimately yourself. 
* Respect their input: Recruiting is not your profession, it's theirs. Any advise received should thoroughly considered. Tweaking the JD a bit or broadening the search criteria for people might make it a lot easier for them to sell the job. 
* Give Feedback about candidates. Especially the positive. Keep in mind that you are not looking for a "not terrible" but for a "great" employee. A great employee is not characterised by what he does not do but by what he _does_ do.
