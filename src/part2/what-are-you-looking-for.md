# What are you looking for? 

Someone in your company has decided, that there is a job position to be filled - and you are on the interview panel. In my experience, the key to any successful hiring lies in the preparation. Regardless if you are the hiring manager or just in the committee, be sure to have a clear understanding of the following points, before you interview anyone. Even more important, have a conversation with the interview committee on all these things to ensure you all share the same understanding. 

## What are the key attributes or skills for that position? 

Many JDs are very long and list a plethora of skills and experience as required. Unfortunately, people rarely fit such a shape. They bring their unique set of skills and experience, and you’ll never find whoever is described in the JD. You will most likely meet people that wow you. Not because how close they match your requirements but because of something entirely different. 

To give you a personal example: I was once looking to hire a team lead. The team to be lead was very senior and responsible for a mission critical service. I was determined that “experience as people manager” was an absolute must have for such a team. Surprisingly quickly we found the perfect candidate, that wowed everyone. She fit perfectly with the company’s values, was a total cultural fit for the team and her technical experience just blew it. She had almost everything, except that she had never been a people manager before. She also had, however, the eagerness to learn and the humbleness to accept and react to feedback in a great way. We introduced her to the team to see if the team would also want to work with her (knowing that she had been a lead developer, but not a people manager before). Everyone agreed that she was the right choice. 

We did hire her, and she thrived. 

The are some conclusions to be drawn from that story. The most important one for me is that the right candidate will make you want to compromise. At the same time, it’s important that the hiring committee talks about such things. The understanding of what exactly you’re expecting from a position often develops over time. It’s hard to have that understanding upfront, but once you meet some candidates, it develops. 


## How can we make the team better? 

For this one, I like the sports metaphor a lot. In almost every team game, you have offense and defense positions. A great team it not one that only has a single rock star that everyone's supporting. Neither is it one that only has offense players. 

Great team are a mix of skills; people who complement each other. If you’re looking to extend an existing team, think about which personality traits could add “DNA to the pool”. Are most people in the team extroverts? Maybe an introvert could bring a bit more relaxation and balance. Are people rather risk averse? How about looking for someone who likes a bit of thrill once in a while and will encourage people to get out of their comfort zone. 

For a team of highly specialized individuals - how about a generalist, who can act as the glue in the middle. 

Such considerations will usually not be the primary criterion, but being aware of them and having them in mind will give some input for discussion. 

## What about Diversity? 

People of different gender, age, nationality (or any other difference for that matter) working together do make a huge difference. Smarter people than me have written a lot about that subject. There is a lot of information about the benefits of diverse cultures at the workplace. 

I will only say that I do personally not enjoy working in a monoculture. Therefore, I do encourage you to read more on that matter. 

## Is the position set up for success? 

There are so many jobs, that are created for the wrong reason. As a matter of fact, a book called “Bullshit Jobs” has been written on that matter. Ask yourself the question: is it fair to ask someone to work in that position? Will this job be relevant just half a year from now? Could you ever consider working in that job? If the answer  to any of these questions is “no”, then you’re probably creating a bullshit job. 

Chances are, that people will not be interested in applying for that position, or they will not accept your offer because they’ve realized this already. 

My recommendation is - don’t hire people for such kind of jobs. In the best case, you’ll just be burning a lot of money time spent in interviews or recruiting. Consider contractors for such things. 

## Is Relocation an option? 

This will often be decided by the senior management of the company. The result of that decision will however change the way you interview. If relocation is an option, think about how your interview process will look like? At least some of the interviews will probably not be done in person, because of cost and logistics to fly people in for these interviews.
