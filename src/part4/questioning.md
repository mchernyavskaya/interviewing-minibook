# Questioning

You went past the introduction of the interview - and now it is time for the questions. When asking interview questions, you _always_ want to extract as much information from the candidate as possible. Every bit will help you reaching a final conclusion. That is, if the answer you get is what you asked for. 

## Asking Questions

There are several questioning techniques to ask for questions. I like behavioral questions a lot. In such questions, you ask the candidate for a past behavior that exhibits the trait you are looking for. I've introduced the concept already when talking about preparing the interview structure. As a short reminder, you'd rather ask: "Can you tell me about a project where you managed to hit a tough deadline?" than "Can you deliver under pressure?". 

To get all the information you want from a specific question, it's most likely, that you've got to do follow up questions. To stay with the example above: If you ask for a project with a tough deadline, the candidate would most likely spend some time explaining you what the project was about. Them most often, he/she would go into how the whole team pulled this out together and how much of a success it was. That's not enough information yet. For all you know, that at least one person in the team was able to deliver under pressure. You don't know the candidate's contribution to the success. You also don't know the consequences of their action. Did they force it through but afterwards three people quit? What does the candidate think about how this project was handled? Maybe the decision for how to make the deadline was not his to make, yet he would have had a better solution. Finally, what did he/she learn from the experience and do different next time?  

This is where I would like to introduce two similar question techniques: STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and SOARA (Situation, Objective, Action, Result, Aftermath). They are very easy to apply and help you get an exhaustive answer to all that you would like to know. You can think of SOARA as an extension of STAR with only one question added to the end. Let's look at how they work. 

In both models, each letter of the acronym stands for a question you ask the candidate on a specific topic: 

| STAR      | SOARA     | Question                                                     |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Situation | Situation | Describe a recent challenge/task/situation? (e.g. "Can you tell me about a project where you managed to hit a tough deadline") |
| Task      | Objective | What was the interviewees Task or Objective in that described situation? (e.g.  "What were you responsible for in that project?") |
| Action    | Action    | What did he/she do to accomplish the challenge? (e.g. "As the most senior engineer on the project, there must have been a lot of eyes on you, right? What did you do to ensure to stay on track with the deadline?") |
| Result    | Result    | What was the result? (e.g. "Was the project a financial success in the end?" or "What was the feedback from the customer?") |
|           | Aftermath | What happened after the project? What were the learnings of consequences? (e.g. "If you had to do that project again, what would you do differently?" or "Would you make the same decisions now too?") |

When applied, this model will help a lot to get information out of the candidate. Please also consider, that you might ask several questions for each of the stages to ensure you get a good picture. You can also use the model _as a spiral_ to drill down even further in specific subparts: Let's say the interviewee mentions that the project was under a tight deadline that was not to be missed, yet confidentiality was highly important. If you're interested in the confidentiality part, you could ask for why confidentiality was such an important constraint (situation) and take it from there. However don't start a new question thread before you're done with the current one. That way you can easily derail your questionnaire. You might not return to the original questions to finish up or - when you do - the candidate might be utterly confused. 

Most likely, some of the questions, you want to ask, will not make a lot of sense as SOARA or STAR questions. That's okay, your questions aren't cats that love to squeeze in any box they can find. Especially, when doing skill questions, the model can become a bit ridiculous. "Can you tell me about a situation where a patient came to see you complaining about a cold?" - not working. Still try to ask these questions as open questions - seeking for an explanation rather than a yes/no answer. Keep in mind however, that you can use follow up questions nevertheless.  

## Question dos and don'ts 

### Help the Candidate to Thrive

When the candidate is in, you want him or her to give their "A" game as much as they want themselves to do just that. The reason is simple: If _the most perfect_ applicant in the world would sit in front of you having a bad day, you might end up not hiring him. If a clear non fit is having the day of his life, you will probably notice that in the process and never end up making an offer. 

There's many ways to do that. Ensure he/she gets good directions about how to find your company. If you know a candidate is coming, prepare the front desk to know what to do with him/her. Ask if he/she wants a drink, take their jacket,... In the interview, accept the fact that people might be nervous and need some time more time to answers. 

### Do tough questions

First of all, keep in mind that your job in the question part is to prove the candidate does _not_ match. This is because you can't prove the opposite. Not any number of questions in an interview process will proof that the candidate will perform in the end. Therefore, it is okay to ask hard questions. Nobody is helped if that person eventually gets fired of the job within weeks because he/she didn't tick required boxes. 

### Take notes (immediately or straight after)

Most often, the final hiring decision is not made straight after your interview. So you'll need to remember the details of this conversation for a while. Most often, you're not talking to just one person for that job but to several. Telling them apart and exactly remember who said what can become quite a challenge. 

Therefore write down some notes - either in the interview or straight after. 

### You can interrupt the candidate

Very often, candidates misinterpret a question and start giving you a long explanation of something else. Interrupting people _is_ impolite for sure. In this case it's a bit different. If the interviewee does not give you the answers you want to hear, they will probably not pass the interview. Therefore interrupting them, when they go off topic it is in _their_ interest too. 

Please take this advice with a pinch of salt: there are many ways to interrupt people. Some of them are polite. Also consider that the interviewee might have gotten your question right but believes that you need to know some detail _before_ hearing the answer.  

### Be Respectful 

It's very likely, that you'll have a candidate who is utterly nervous, blacks out or just applied for a job without possessing the required knowledge. Whatever happens, stay respectful. I've had situations where a candidate we rejected recommended us to friends nevertheless. 

If you are in such a situation where it is obvious it is okay to pause and ask the candidate if there is something happening. Alternatively, you can also mix in some simpler questions to give the candidate a chance to shine at some questions to build up confidence again. 

### Note the "Crap" 

One part of my evaluation is if and how often candidates say something negative about past employers or colleagues. Obviously, they're sitting in this interview for a good reason so there must be _something_ about their current work situation, they're unhappy about. 

There is - however - a big difference between saying: "the company is going in the wrong way" and "I don't buy into the direction anymore". The former showing a "My way or the highway"  attitude. The latter one saying that there is a disagreement. When teamwork is important, the cowboy approach will not work very well. After all, would someone who believes his entire previous company is misguided and only he can see clear respect feedback from peers? Furthermore: such conversations are okay to have with a good friend over a beer. But surely they are not another company's business. 

Therefore, I listen for anything negative that was said explicitly or just implied. If I see a pattern, that's a flag for me to not hire. 

### Listen to your Instincts

There are times, when you do get the right answers from a candidate but _there is something_ you just can't tell. It's **very** important that you handle them appropriately. What your gut tells you comes from the experience you've made in your life - even if you are not consciously aware of it. You're indeed might be facing an unconscious bias but there are also chances, it's something else. Therefore, don't neglect that instinct, instead validate it with the hiring committee or with someone from HR. If it is just you, neglect it. If you all have the feeling there's something, be cautious. 

I've had two rather dramatic cases where my instinct was right, even if I could not tell. The first person ended up not being hired, because he called our HR manager "chick" in the interview with her. The second person seemed a bit _off_ but we hired him anyways. Later I learned that the _off_ part were typical side effects coming from ecstasy consumption.   

### Don't rephrase questions over and over

Unexperienced interviewers often do this: They ask a question but immediately are dissatisfied with it. So they'll rephrase, only to find out that they got it wrong in a different way once again - guess what? They'll give you a third version of the question: "Can you tell me of a project where you had a large customer base where some where hard to handle? How do you deal with difficult customers? How do you ensure that customers stay up to date with project changes?"

The problem with this is: There's no way to answer properly because there are multiple questions that essentially ask for different things. Consider the example above: one asks for a story about a project with many customers. The second asks for handling difficult customers and the third one for stakeholder management. It can be very hard to tell what the interviewer wants to hear exactly. Most likely they'll get it wrong and tell you something you didn't want to hear. 

Instead, wait a second, think and then ask the question. If you feel you got it wrong, don't rephrase. You'll just make it worse. Wait for the answer, and see. 

### Don't go overtime

Keep track of the time. Remember that the candidate might have questions too. Prepare to end questioning latest 10 minutes before the end of the interview. You can time this a bit by preparing some questions that will likely have a shorter answer at the end of the time. 

There's a couple of reasons, why this is important: First, being on time is professional and will make a good impression. Second, even if you are able to go overtime, the candidate might not (often it's already hard to make time for the interview call on it's own). Also keep in mind, that interviewers have way more time to get to know the candidates than the other way around. The 10 minutes at the end of the interviews is all the question time, they'll be getting. In the end, they need to make their decision if they want to work with you based on that

### Don't use your computer or phone

It's a great idea to take notes during interview. However, please keep them on paper. Studies have shown that the [sheer presence of a smartphone lying on a table](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462) can be a major distraction. Let alone you talk to a person who is typing into a computer at that time. 

Even if you don't mind, other people do - and it will make them perform below their capabilities. Leading to unnecessary false negatives and increased hiring costs. 

The alternative is just to put your notes onto a good old piece of paper. Remember however, that by writing things down, you are recording personal information which is highly confidential. Therefore, be sure to keep the notes securely - or even better - destroy them at the end of the interview process.
