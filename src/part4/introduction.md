# Introduction

You're sitting in a conference room and a person, you've never seen in your life walks in. Or maybe it's a Skype call? Interviews are artificial conversations that have a tendency to be a bit awkward. How do you start the conversation? 

It is general wisdom that the first impression sticks, and that the beginning of a conversation shapes the rest of the conversation. If it starts uncomfortable and awkward, chances are it's not going to get any better. 

In such a situation, candidates will realize that "it's not running too well" and get more nervous. Thus not giving the smart answers they could give you when being calm. When a candidate is in such a state, it's to everyone's disadvantage. You've both lost on an opportunity. For you representing your company, you're going to reject someone who might have been a perfect fit just because he was too nervous in an interview. Great matches don't show up that often, so you will most likely have to talk to 10 more people to find the next.  

Therefore, a good and nice start into the conversation matters. 

As I mentioned before, your two goals here are to give a human face (yourself) to the company and to help the candidate relax a bit. 

We've all been through hostile interviews. At the time, the candidate gets a call, he might expect just that. Start out by showing that you care. This is why I emphasize on the "know the candidates name" thing so much. If you are not able to pronounce the name correctly you can be humble and ask for help. Being an Austrian, working at international corpoates, I can tell you that everyone who asks me if he says my name correctly collects a big brownie point with me. Speaking more tactically, by admitting you need help, you drop your defense a bit, making you appear much more "real" and less like a question bot in the first place. 

Take some minutes to do a bit of small talk - probably any topic will do. If there is something you found in the CV that interests you, go for that. I once had a candidate who put wrestling into his CV. So I said that I found this really cool and wondered how he would have gotten into this. It does not need to be something that specific. Think about something that builds a bridge to the candidate. Is he from Italy and you've been there once on holiday? If you are not a "small talker" and this sounds rather daunting, then rest assured that this is nothing mere than a skill. Once you've done it at 10 or 20 interviews, you get a lot better at it. If it helps, remember that the goal of this small talk is to help the candidate relax a little. They will appreciate your effort for sure! 

There are some alternatives to the small talk to break the ice. Some people talk a bit about the company and some ask if there is any questions the candidate would have. Both are good things to do. Keep in mind however, that the candidate might have had a couple of interviews already. Therefore giving him yet another intro to the company might not really be that valuable to him. 

To wrap up this phase, give the candidate a short introduction about the interview itself - what it is that you'll be talking about.
