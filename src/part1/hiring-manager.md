# The Hiring Manager

If you are going to be the future manger of the employee to be hired or you have the last decision in who is going to be hired or not, you are the hiring manager. 

The responsibility of the hiring manager is to fill his/her vancancy with a fitting candidate on time and budget.  

## The Moralistic Aspect

There's a second, hidden, responsibility in the job: It's the responsibility to do _the right thing_. The person who signs with your company is putting a lot at risk to come work with you. At this time he can't do anything but trust that you told him the truth about the company and there was nothing terrible that was not mentioned in the interviews. It can require quite a bit of bravery to make this step. The least thing you can do is to ensure this person gets hired for the right reasons, that you are as confident as can be that he/she will perform in the job and fit the team. If you are not sure about this at the end of an interview stream - don't hire. I would argue that this is the only moralistic decision you can make. 

Finally, there is one important thing to say: I do not believe that there is good or bad employees or applicants. Every human is a special being; we all have something we are uniquely good at. The difficult task is to find a space in which we can shine. This is as true for any candidate as it is for you and me. 

## The Firing Manager

It's important to remember that the responsibility for the hire does not end with having a contract signed. Once the new employee starts, the hiring manager's responsibilties are to ensure proper onboarding and to verify the hire. Having to terminate that person is probably next to the worst result of a hiring. Not only does this mean a big time and money loss for the company. Even more importantly, the person who surely suffers most from is the person who just got fired and might now have to face dramatic financial consequences. 

It is - however - not the worst case scenario for a hiring process. The worst case is that a person joins the team who is a clear misfit. Maybe it is his negative attitude, maybe it is a lack of skills. Keeping a non fit around in the team can (and often will) make everyone feel miserable. If not corrected timely, that can lead to high performers leaving the company because they do not enjoy working with the team anymore. 

I put a lot of emphasis on this, because for many of us who just got promoted to be people managers, the thought of having to fire someone is the most scary thing. It certainly was to me. For that reason, remember that if you start hiring people, you might also start firing people. It's not beautiful; nobody gets used to it; certainly nobody enjoys it. It's the worst thing that being a manager has to offer. Nevertheless, it's part of the job. 

The best thing we can do as managers to prevent this is to do the best we can to take hiring seriously and to give people clear and early feedback when things are not working out.
