# Kinds of Interviews

There are many ways to evaluate a candidate and come to a hiring decision. For this book, I will focus on classic interviews, in which one candidate receives questions or tasks from one (or more) interviewers and answers to them right away. I'll try to outline the most common ones below and give some suggestions in which scenario they apply or might be valuable. A good interview process can contain several of them.  

## Interview

A normal interview is conducted by an interviewer who presents challenges to the interviewee. These challenges are typically questions or short tasks. Not more detail here, because this is what the entire book is about. 

## Task/Exercise

The candidate is presented with a task that he performs in front of the interviewer. The interviewer might interrupt him at any time to ask questions _why_ or _what if_ questions.  Often such a task takes 60-90 minutes. Finishing the task may _not always_ be necessary or even possible. The goal is usually to prove one candidate's skills by seeing them in action. Doing this in real time gives the opportunity to drill down into specifics, understand the candidate's way of thinking or just help him to focus on the right thing. 

## Homework

The candidate gets a task as a written assignment that he has to finish by a given date. This task can be a bit larger in nature, and is often similar to the Task/Exercise interview. Once the task is completed the candidate presents his solution to the interviewer. This can be a quite effective way for candidates to show their skills and it definitely helps take out the stress of the exercise. However, homeworks _are_ very demotivational. You will not hear back from a lot of candidates after handing them out the exercise. This can be okay - depending on your industry or brand as employer. 

## Meet the Team

If you want to ensure that the candidate is a great fit for the team, a _meet the team_ session might be the right thing to do. It is usually rather short. The interviewee will meet at least some people of the team over a coffee or in the conference room for an informal conversation. The goal of the interview is not only to ensure the candidate matches but also that the team feels good about hiring that person. 

## Panel Interview

A panel is an interview in which the candidate is confronted with not one but many interviewers, who will ask questions together. This is a _very_ tough situation for a candidate, because every answer he gives is thought through by many people at once. And one of them is always going to find a _nasty_ question to ask. 

I really like this interview for senior management positions where having to give good answers under pressure in front of many people with little time to think is not too unusual.

I would _never_ do this for junior positions because it's probably going to scare the interviewee. It's also a very expensive form of interview, because of the entire panel is kept busy for each candidate. 

## Case Study

A Case Study is a special kind of Homework interview. It is most often used for highly senior or leadership positions. A business situation is presented to the candidate, which he has to think through and provide a strategic solution.
