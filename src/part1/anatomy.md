# Anatomy of a Hiring Process

Any candidate applying for your position will typically undergo these steps: 

1. Application: the candidate has applied for a job directly or has expressed her/his interest in the job to your recruiter. 
1. Review of the CV and motivation letter (if present): Someone will be looking at the CV to decide if that application could be considered for the position. 
1. First Interview: This is sometimes done by the recruiter or by HR. It’s often a quick check if the candidate could be a match to the company. Often the candidate is asked for salary expectations at this point. 
1. Interviews: Several interviews are held with the candidates. Depending on the position, some of the interviews will test skills while other will evaluate soft-skills, experience or fit to the company.  
1. Final Decision: After all interviews are passed, the hiring committee sits together and decides if an offer should be made
1. Offer: An offer (containing position, compensation, benefits and responsibilities) is sent to the candidate. 
1. Signature: Candidate signs the work contract 
1. On Boarding: Once the contract is signed, the onboarding of that candidate starts. Onboarding can and should start with some soft and nice parts before the candidate even started to work in your company. e.g. invite him/her to company events, give them some information about the company, share important news and successes. Basically do everything to keep the excitement up.  I consider onboarding extremely important to ensure an employee’s success in the company. At the same time, this part of hiring is outside the scope of this article. 

While this is the general skeleton of an application, it’s important to know that a candidate can drop out of the process after any phase, when it becomes clear that the he/she does not possess qualifications to execute the job. What is even more important is to note, that a candidate who proceeds through all interviews should not automatically get a job offer.
Before an offer is made, all interviewers should sit together in a room and make a shared decision about that. I’ve seen many cases, where little concerns seen by one interviewer were either confirmed or dispersed by other interviewers. 

Generally, a good interview process should aim at filtering out candidates that do not match as early as possible. This is also, why salary expectations are often being asked at the very beginning of the interview process. If no agreement on salary can be made, what’s the point of doing all these interviews? 

When I started interviewing people, I felt bad about rejecting candidates. Instead I made the mistake of letting candidates pass to the next stage too often, even when it was quite clear that the candidate would not make it through. I’ve reverted my opinion about that. I work full time and have a kid at home. Organizing time to do an interview can be a struggle. Being asked to do this in order to find a new job is just reasonable. At the same time, it’s disrespectful of my time, my wife’s and my son’s time to invite me to interviews, where the decision that I won’t make it had been made already.
