# The Hiring Comittee

Deciding to hire someone, can be quite daunting, because of all the potential consequences of hiring the wrong person. For that reason, one should never make the decision alone. I recommend that there should be at least three different people talking to potential candidates. A lot of reasons, why several people should see a candidate will be found in a later chapter. 

It’s the job of this committee to successfully fill an open vacancy. After all interviews for a candidate have passed, the committee sits together and discusses if an offer should be sent. There is a high risk in this decision for candidate and company, so this meeting should not be taken lightweight. I prefer to start by having everyone start to share his impression (highlights and concerns). Once done, we’d show thumbs up/down on the count of 3. If there is no common agreement, discussion continues until a decision is made. 

It is quite naturally and healthy that during these discussion, a clearer picture of the requirements for the job will emerge. As you’re seeing more candidates you’ll develop a shared understanding of what to look for and what it is that you actually want.
