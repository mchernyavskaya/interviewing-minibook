# Better Job Interviews

Searching for a job and hiring a new employee have something in common: Both are frustrating tasks that lack a happy and all too often. With employee engagement and tenures declining over the last decades it's clear that something isn't working out. 

My interpretation is that many people have a job they do not enjoy, work with a company they do not care for or are part of a team they do not like. As a result, we spend almost a quarter of our time given by doing something we do not like. Why do we accept this? In most cases, because many of us have come to the conclusion that this is normal and have stopped looking for better. 

I don't think that this is good enough. 

To start making a difference, we need to improve the matchmaking of employees and employers. A process that is more commonly referred to as "hiring". We need to _make better job_ interviews. As a result, we will find people who better fit in the company. This in turn will lead to more engaged and higher performing team. 

This book is a collections of my thoughts, experiences and learnings on the subject on interviewing. If you have not done interviews before, it will give you a good overview of how an interviewing process typically looks like. If you are an experienced interviewer, there might be some interesting thoughts about how to prepare for interviews as well as how to ask questions in the book.  

What entitles me to write about interviewing? I've been quite successful building and leading a couple of teams in the last five years. The ideas and thoughts expressed in here will represent my own learnings and opinions. This is not the result of proper research. This is very unscientific - It is just my experience. 

If you have any feedback - positive or negative, I _love_ to hear about it. Please feel free to post it into the [Make Better Interviews Linkedin Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8718539/).
