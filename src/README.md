# Better Job Interviews

Searching for a job and hiring a new employee have something in common: They are tiring tasks that take longer than one would love. The results are often far from ideal. With employee engagement and tenures constantly declining over the last decades it's clear that something isn't working out. 

My interpretation is that many people have a job they do not enjoy or work with a company or a team they do not like. Employers on the other hand get frustrated by tedious hiring processes and start making compromises. As a result, we spend almost a quarter of our time given by doing something we do not like. Why do we accept this? In most cases, because many of us have come to the conclusion that this is normal and have stopped looking for better. 

I don't think that this is good enough. 

To start making a difference, we need to improve the matchmaking of employees and employers. A process that is more commonly referred to as "hiring". 

I believe we as interviewers and hiring managers can make a difference in this. If we all learn how to run _better job interviews_ we can get a long way. Getting better at that means two things: First to become more aware, what the job is actually about. Second finding better strategies to identify applicants that are going to be a great hire faster and more reliably. 

This minibook was inspired by a friend of mine. She got promoted and will need to start running interviews soon. She confessed, that she was a bit nervous as she had no idea about how to do. There was no material or support available from her employer. I offered to send her some articles and material to give her a bit of help. Only to realize, _how little_ information is available on the web or in print. For those of us who don't have a company paying for such training, this minibook comes for free. 

What entitles me to write about interviewing? I've been quite successful building and leading a couple of teams in the last five years. The ideas and thoughts expressed in here will represent my own learnings who come from the IT industry but - as I believe - hold true for any other field. By no means are the contents here backed by any proper research. Indeed, this is very unscientific. It is just my experience. 

If you have any feedback - be it positive or negative, I would love to hear about it. Please feel free to post it into this [Linkedin Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8718539/).
