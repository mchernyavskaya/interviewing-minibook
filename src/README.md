# Better Job Interviews

Searching for a job and hiring a new employee have something in common: both are frustrating tasks that lack a happy ending all too often. With employee engagement and tenures declining over the last decades, it's clear that something isn't working out.

My interpretation of this is that many people have a job they do not enjoy, work for a company they do not care for or are part of a team they do not like. As a result, we spend almost a quarter of our lifetime doing something we do not like. Why do we accept this? In most cases, because many of us have come to the conclusion that this is normal and stopped looking for a better life. 

I don't think that this is good enough. I don't think this is something that we should accept.

I think we can do better.

To start making a difference, we need to improve the matchmaking between employees and employers. A process that is more commonly referred to as "hiring". We need to _do a better job_ interviewing people. As a result, we will find people who better fit in the company. This in turn will lead to more engaged and higher performing teams.

This book is a collections of my thoughts, experiences and learnings on the subject of *interviewing*. If you have not done interviews before, it will give you a good overview of how an interviewing process typically looks like. If you are an experienced interviewer, you still might find some interesting insights about how to prepare for interviews, as well as how to ask questions.  

What entitles me to write about interviewing? I've been quite successful building and leading a couple of teams in the last five years. The ideas and thoughts expressed here will represent my own learnings and opinions. This is not the result of proper research. This is very unscientific - it is just my experience. 

If you have any feedback - positive or negative, - I would _love_ to hear it. Please feel free to post it into the [Make Better Interviews Linkedin Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8718539/).
