# Make Better Job Interviews

A good friend of mine got promoted recently. Soon she’ll have to do interviews. When we were visiting her recently, she told me how unsure she was about how to run good interviews. Unsurprisingly, there was very little process or documentation about that matter present in her company. 

I did quite a lot of interviews in the last years. So I promised to send her some articles on the matter. A couple of google searches later I learnt, that there is very little good content to be found on the web. 

For that reason, I thought it might be helpful for some, if I share my personal experiences here in this article. As a preface, please note, that i am not the expert on the matter. The following is an aggregation, of personal findings, suggestions and trainings I attended. Over time, these things have morphed into how I believe good interviews should be run. For that reason, I can’t give proper credit nor can I point to any evidence on a scale larger than my own experience. Yes, this is unscientific.
