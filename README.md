# Interviewing Minibook

I realized that there is not too much information about how to run job interviews well from the perspective of the interviewer. There is a lot of trainers and commercial training material present, none of which is available to the public. 

I believe that finding the right job would be a much nicer and successful endeavor if people would know more about how to interview well: Both, the interviewer and the candidate. 

I would like to share some of my experiences and thoughts about the subject, in the hope that someone finds this valuable.
